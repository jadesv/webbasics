     <p>Should I tell you about how the first Christmas, before vaccines, before it was even that easy to find tests, my partner got sick and we all pretended for Christmas Eve that it was anything but COVID because we had all been exposed already and we desperately wanted to do Christmas. But the next day, Christmas Day, he was sicker and I guess we did have a test because he tested positive. He went into a room by himself. If he came out to pee he wore a mask and rubber gloves and I herded my two kids, aged 5 and 11/2, into the other room and closed the door while he passed. Should I tell you about the next day (or the day after) how his blood oxygen went very low and a doctor he had never met told him over the a screen that he had to go to the emergency room. I didn’t believe that doctor and texted my friend who was an emergency room doctor at Kings County (who had been there for that first wave when they stacked bodies in refrigerated trucks parked on the street in front of hospitals, and who had held a phone to an old woman’s ear while her son told her goodbye over the phone, and the son fought her and fought her to go to his mother’s side and she couldn’t let him and even though I would never ever say this to her part of me thinks she was wrong not to let him, but she spent weeks not seeing her own kids in order to work and so who the fuck am I to have an opinion?) and when she heard my partner’s blood oxygen numbers she quietly told me that he should indeed go to the E.R.  The way I was scared when he left with my step-dad to walk there (a merciful three blocks away) is a thing I avoid but recently (as in, the year 2025) it shoots to the surface, like a blue skybounce ball I’ve tried to submerge. I did not know if I was saying goodbye forever and I collapsed to the floor of the vestibule after he walked away. </p>

     <p>And then I got up. And went up to the kids and we watched the most recent Muppets movie with my friends and their kids over zoom. I told the kids their father had gone to get help getting better.</p>
     <p>But, but, he stabilized. They sent him back. Our family was in quarantine for 21 days. I was actually pretty good at quarantine parenting. We kind of had fun. The next year, again right after Christmas, we did another 20 day quarantine. That was the time I got really sick. I nursed with a mask on, but my toddler got COVID anyway. I remember nursing her to help her get better and feeling a hunger on a cellular level. I felt my own recovery leaving my body. </p>

     <p>Later that spring was when people stopped actually quarantining; if they caught COVID, it just meant that they’d go outside with a mask on. I resented them (“amateurs”), even if I was grateful. It seemed we were finally leaving the epicenter.</p>

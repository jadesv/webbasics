    <h2>My second child was born 11 weeks before New York City went into lockdown.</h2>
    <p>The fear rose like groundwater until it reached my teeth. My oldest was 4 ½. He stopped getting dressed most days. Other days he wore his Buzz Lightyear costume to do a storytelling hour on zoom.  What’s funny is that now (and I think this is a comment on capitalism more than COVID, tbh) he says he misses COVID living. He says he liked it when we were all together all day long and could just do some school for a few hours and then go outside. He doesn’t like how we all rush around all day long at school and work. He has a point. But mothering, parenting, in COVID, the way all caregivers were left to impossible situations, for days and weeks and months. We pulled off miracles. But it doesn’t mean the memory isn’t a pissed off ember. 
At the time, and still, I was a contributor to MUTHA Magazine. I wrote about what it was like. Some of that is here too.

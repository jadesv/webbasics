    <p>I can’t remember when it started exactly, or when I acted on it, but sometime in the second winter I started to understand that I would need to create solitude for myself. It was perhaps odd as a counterpoint to the terribleness of the isolation of the first six months, but, of course, I was never isolated alone. I was locked down and in with a small group of people, all of whom I was responsible to. My kids of course, for whom I now had to supply nearly every physical, emotional, social, spiritual, you-name-it need. But also, my partner. My mother and stepfather. My mother-in-law. A few close friends. We were in care of each other. Which, I mean, thank the gods. But I was not for months, and then a year, ever truly by myself with my own brain and thoughts and feelings and body. And I knew if I didn’t get alone and soon, I was just not going to make it. I wish I could say I didn’t need that classic parenting mantra to get me to put this plan into action, but I did. I did need to tell myself that getting time away from my kids was going to make me a better parent. I shouldn’t have to, but well, misogyny plus capitalism plus global pandemic does a tangled web weave. And so, I devised a plan, inspired by the advice of a person I knew who co-parented happily with their ex. He pointed out that he and his ex had legally mandated time to be alone as adults and that it was kind of the best thing ever. My boo and I decided to put our own version into action (minus the divorce). We called it “the one-night revolution”, or “one night rev” for short. </p>

    <p>Every month we would get 28 consecutive hours off duty, only reachable for emergencies. Like, actual emergencies.  At the time, hotels were dirt cheap and nearly empty, and we did our own brand of COVID vs sanity risk assessment and proceeded. I found an air bnb out in Rockaway (already one of my favorite places) that cost me about $90/night, already one of my favorite places in New York. I can’t remember when exactly I went for the first time, but I kept going, once a month, all seasons. Typically, I spoke to and saw nobody, other than the strangers I passed on the street, or other small-wave, cold-water surfers. I brought writing. I smoked tiny, rollies of tobacco. I reveled in every second and returned the next day in a wonderful mood, ready to be piled with children and send my partner on a walk to get some of his own quiet. Sometimes in life it’s worth recognizing when one is a genius. </p>

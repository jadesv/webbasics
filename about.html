    <h3>About the Author</h3>
    <p>Jade Sanchez-Ventura is a writer and (former) radical educator. Her writing often tackles themes of mixed-race identity, motherhood as a social-justice issue, and romantic partnership rooted in intersectional feminism and sex positivity. Her essays have been published by Seal Press, Slice Literary Magazine, Huffington Post, Kweli Journal, Duende, The Establishment, and others. She was featured on the Bitch Media Popaganda podcast and has been awarded by the Mendocino Coast Writer’s Conference, Slice Literary Conference, and Disquiet International Literary Conference. She is the recipient of residencies with the Writer’s Colony at Dairy Hollow and Garden House, and she is a Hertog fellow.  She is a contributing writer and editor with MUTHA Magazine, for which she has twice been nominated for a Pushcart Prize. As an educator, she believes racial equity and social justice are essential to teaching and spent twelve years practicing this pedagogical approach with the Brooklyn Free School, an urban democratic free school. She now serves on the Brooklyn Free School Board of Trustees. </p>

        <li>Find the best book to read for 35 minutes while you sit in the library,  your baby finally asleep in a carrier, and really you’re just going to close your eyes too, but even just holding the book in your hand will feel good and you know the librarian (me!) knows that you’re probably just going to leave it on the bench anyway. (I do! And it’s ok!)</li>

    <p>Though she has kin around the world, she grew up in Brooklyn, NY and continues to raise her kids there. She is a surfer of very small waves. </p>
